*> The Document Type Declaration, often abbreviated as DOCTYPE, is an important declaration in 
HTML that specifies the document type and version of HTML or XHTML being used in a web page. 
It helps the browser to interpret and render the content correctly.

*> The DOCTYPE declaration is typically placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag.
It is not an HTML tag itself but rather an instruction to the browser about the version of HTML or XHTML used 
in the document.

*> The syntax of a DOCTYPE declaration is:
<!DOCTYPE html>

*> This declaration is commonly used for HTML5 documents.
It informs the browser that the document follows the HTML5 specification.
