Tags are the building blocks of HTML and are used to mark up elements on a webpage.
They consist of opening and closing tags, which enclose the content they are applied to. 
The opening tag contains the name of the element, while the closing tag has a forward slash before the element name.
 For example:
 <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
 Here, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag. The content between these tags forms the paragraph element.

 Elements:
 An element is the combination of a tag and its content.
 ex:
 <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
 In the example above, <p> is the tag, and "This is a paragraph." is the content. Together, they form the <p> element.
 HTML elements can be nested within each other to create a hierarchical structure. 
 For instance:
<div>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
In this example, <div> is a container element that encapsulates both the heading (<h1>) and paragraph (<p>) element
